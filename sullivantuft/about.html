                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm <strong>Sullivan Tuft</strong>, a senior at <strong>Brigham Young University–Idaho</strong> pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with an emphasis in Software Management. I’m passionate about building efficient, user-focused software and thrive in collaborative, problem-solving environments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         My technical experience centers around <strong>C# and the .NET framework</strong>, but I also enjoy working with <strong>React, Python, Kotlin,</strong> and <strong>Dart</strong>. I’ve built web and mobile applications using modern tools like Firebase, APIs, and Git for version control.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         Alongside my technical work, I bring over a year of hands-on experience in team settings that require strong communication, customer service, and leadership—skills I developed both professionally and while serving a mission in West Virginia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm currently working at American Construction Supply, where I provide on-site service, coordinate logistics, and ensure timely deliveries with professionalism and attention to detail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         When I'm not coding or studying, I'm most likely learning from real-world projects, playing basketball, or working toward graduation in April 2026.
                    </p>
